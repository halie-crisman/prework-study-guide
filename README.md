# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

The motivation behind this project was to create a platform where I can easily access all of the material I have learned throughout the prework. It alows me to quickly access material from one place rather then searching throughout the prework material for the most pertinent information regarding HTML, CSS, JS, and GitHub. I learned some basics to coding prior to entering bootcamp that I was not aware of. I feel it will allow the transition into bootcamp to be more seemless.

## Usage

The prework study guide is a tool that bootcamp students can use to freshen up on the material they worked through in the prework assignment. There are four sections on the study guide that contain notes about certain topics, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. While using the study guide if you were to open the DevTools console you can see those specific listed topics we learned from prework. The function we created in the study guide chooses a topic for us to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
