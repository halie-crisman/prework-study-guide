        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element, never closing element.</li>
          <li> An element is a type of content on a webpage. The following element types are commonly used to add content to pages: text elements, image elements, header elements, and list elements.</li>
          <li>Here are some common element types that are used to divide and describe a page: meta-related elements, content division elements, and semantic elements.</li>
          <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
          <li>The <head> element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included within the <head> are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The <body> element contains the content that is shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case-sensitive; HTML elements are case-sensitive.</li>
          <li>The <head> element contains the metadata for our web application. Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS = programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization
          </li>
          <li>We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options</li>
          <li>When a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. They’re useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.
          </li>
          <li> Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.</li>
        </ul>
